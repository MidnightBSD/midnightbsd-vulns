summary: Make sure target username is initialized in doas
details: This is a minor fix to the previous check that handled multiple usernames with a single UID. It was possible for the target username in this case to not be properly initialised (depending on code path and compiler settings)/ Helmat has introduced a correction for this to make sure the target name is always initialized properly.
