summary: TCP spoofing vulnerability in pf(4)
details: An attacker can, with relatively little effort, inject packets into a
  TCP stream destined to a host behind a pf firewall.  This could be used
  to implement a denial-of-service attack for hosts behind the firewall,
  for example by sending TCP RST packets to the host.
