summary: OpenSSH pre-authentication async signal safety issue
details: A signal handler in sshd(8) may call a logging function that is not async-
  signal-safe.  The signal handler is invoked when a client does not
  authenticate within the LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default).  This signal
  handler executes in the context of the sshd(8)'s privileged code, which is
  not sandboxed and runs with full root privileges.
  
  This issue is another instance of the problem in CVE-2024-6387 addressed by
  FreeBSD-SA-24:04.openssh.  The faulty code in this case is from the
  integration of blacklistd in OpenSSH in FreeBSD and MidnightBSD.
  
  As a result of calling functions that are not async-signal-safe in the
  privileged sshd(8) context, a race condition exists that a determined
  attacker may be able to exploit to allow an unauthenticated remote code
  execution as root.

aliases:
  - CVE-2024-7589
  - FreeBSD-SA-24:18.ctl
recommendations: If sshd(8) cannot be updated, this signal handler race condition can be
  mitigated by setting LoginGraceTime to 0 in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and
  restarting sshd(8).  This makes sshd(8) vulnerable to a denial of service
  (the exhaustion of all MaxStartups connections), but makes it safe from the
  remote code execution presented in this advisory.
  
  Update to MidnightBSD 3.2.1 release by using the normal update procedure.
