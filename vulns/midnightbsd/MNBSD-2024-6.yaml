id: MNBSD-2024-6
summary: OpenSSH pre-authentication remote code execution
details: A signal handler in sshd(8) calls a function that is not async-signal-safe.
  The signal handler is invoked when a client does not authenticate within the
  LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default).  This signal handler executes in the
  context of the sshd(8)'s privileged code, which is not sandboxed and runs
  with full root privileges.
  
  This issue is a regression of CVE-2006-5051 originally reported by Mark Dowd
  and accidentally reintroduced in OpenSSH 8.5p1.
  
  As a result of calling functions that are not async-signal-safe in the
  privileged sshd(8) context, a race condition exists that a determined
  attacker may be able to exploit to allow an unauthenticated remote code
  execution as root

aliases:
  - CVE-2024-6387
  - FreeBSD-SA-24:04.openssh
recommendations: If sshd(8) cannot be updated, this signal handler race condition can be
  mitigated by setting LoginGraceTime to 0 in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and
  restarting sshd(8).  This makes sshd(8) vulnerable to a denial of service
  (the exhaustion of all MaxStartups connections), but makes it safe from the
  remote code execution presented in this advisory.
  
  Update to MidnightBSD 3.2.0 release by using the normal update procedure.
