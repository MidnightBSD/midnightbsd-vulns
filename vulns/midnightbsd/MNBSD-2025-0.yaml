summary: Unprivileged access to system files
details: When etcupdate encounters conflicts while merging files, it saves a version
  containing conflict markers in /var/db/etcupdate/conflicts.  This version does
  not preserve the mode of the input file, and is world-readable.  This applies
  to files that would normally have restricted visibility, such as
  /etc/master.passwd. An unprivileged local user may be able to read encrypted root and user
  passwords from the temporary master.passwd file created in
  /var/db/etcupdate/conflicts.  This is possible only when conflicts within the
  password file arise during an update, and the unprotected file is deleted when
  conflicts are resolved.
