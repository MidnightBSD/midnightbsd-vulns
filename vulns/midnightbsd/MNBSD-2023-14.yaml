summary: libc stdio buffer overflow
details: For line-buffered streams the __sflush() function did not correctly update
  the FILE object's write space member when the write(2) system call returns
  an error.
  Depending on the nature of an application that calls libc's stdio functions
  and the presence of errors returned from the write(2) system call (or an
  overridden stdio write routine) a heap buffer overflow may occur.  Such
  overflows may lead to data corruption or the execution of arbitrary code at
  the privilege level of the calling program.
