summary:  PEAP in wpa_supplicant allows authentication bypass
details: The implementation of PEAP in wpa_supplicant through 2.10 allows authentication bypass. For a successful attack, 
  wpa_supplicant must be configured to not verify the network's TLS certificate during Phase 1 authentication, and an 
  eap_peap_decrypt vulnerability can then be abused to skip Phase 2 authentication. The attack vector is sending an EAP-TLV 
  Success packet instead of starting Phase 2. This allows an adversary to impersonate Enterprise Wi-Fi networks.
