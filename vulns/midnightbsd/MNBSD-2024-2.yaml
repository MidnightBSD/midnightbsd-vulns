summary:  Certificate revocation list fetch(1) option fails
details: The fetch(3) library uses environment variables for passing certain
  information, including the revocation file pathname.  The environment variable
  name used by fetch(1) to pass the filename to the library was incorrect, in
  effect ignoring the option. Fetch would still connect to a host presenting a certificate included in the
  revocation file passed to the --crl option.

recommendations: The certificate revocation list file can be specified by the SSL_CRL_FILE
  fetch(3) environment variable rather than using the --crl option to fetch(1). 
  Update to MidnightBSD 3.2.1 release by using the normal update procedure.
