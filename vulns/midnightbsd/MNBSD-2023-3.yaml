summary: Double free after calling PEM_read_bio_ex
details: The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and
  decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the payload
  data.  If the function succeeds then the "name_out", "header" and "data"
  arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant
  decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is
  possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In
  this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the
  header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed.
