summary:  Unbound DNSSEC DOS attack
details: Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote 
  attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the "KeyTrap" issue. 
  One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification 
  implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.
